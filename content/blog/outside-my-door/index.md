How many telephone poles do you think you've looked at in your lifetime? I haven't counted, but I've looked at a lot â€“almost always withing meaning to or even noticing. I have absolutely no expertise in the area but I've always been uncomfortable with how I've allowed such a pervasive protrusions to surround me at all times without a second thought. I'm troubled by how little I know about them. Sometimes I feel like don't know anything about anything.

Look around yourself right now. What do you know about the things that surround you?

All I really know is what my eyes can see in this moment. I don't really know how anything around me came to be or why it is. I take for granted how complex and interdependent our modern world has become. I feel ungrateful for the human and economic surpluses I unknowingly benefit from.

I want to learn more about everything. I want to indulge my curiosity about why things are the way that they are -and perhaps, make them better. That's what this site is for, I'm going to write about what I learn.

I'm calling this "Outside My Door" because things out in the big wide world intrigue me the most. Even the simplest things like doormats -which happen to be _immediately_ outside my door, but really I'm going to learn about and write about anything that I want.

I hope I can relay what I learn in interesting ways. Thanks for reading.
